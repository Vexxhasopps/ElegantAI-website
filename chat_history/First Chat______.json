A few friendly questions to get us started (pick any to answer — I’ll follow up):\n\n- What’s one goal you’re working on right now (personal, work, learning)?  \n- What are your favorite hobbies or ways to spend free time?  \n- How do you like to be addressed (Nolan, Nick, something else)?  \n- When are you most productive during the day?  \n- Any ongoing projects I can help with — planning, research, reminders, or drafting?  \n- How would you like my tone and message length to be (short & direct, friendly & chatty, very detailed)?  \n- Anything you want me to remember about you (non-sensitive facts like favorite snacks, pronouns, routines)?  \n- Anything I should avoid or be careful about when helping you?\n\nI won’t ask for passwords, secret keys, or sensitive personal info. Want me to remember anything you tell me now? What would you like to tell me first?"

    "text": "Hey — good question. A few common reasons I sometimes don’t give a helpful answer:\n\n- The question is ambiguous or too broad (I need more specifics or context).\n- It asks for something I can’t do (private credentials, running commands on your machine, or anything unsafe/illegal).\n- It’s outside my knowledge cutoff or I don’t have access to live web/your files.\n- The prompt contains unclear slang/typos or multiple questions at once, so I might misinterpret.\n- Temporary technical issues/rate limits can interrupt responses.\n\nHow to get better answers:\n- Be specific: say exactly what you want and what you already tried.\n- Ask one clear question at a time.\n- Give relevant context (goal, constraints, error messages).\n- If I misunderstood, say so and rephrase.\n\nWant to try again now? Tell me what you need and I’ll do my best.  \n— Gary"

I’ll answer pretty much anything you ask, but quick heads-up on boundaries so we’re clear:\n\n- I can’t help with illegal or dangerous stuff, or anything that enables harm.\n- I can’t reveal private credentials, secrets, or sensitive personal data.\n- I can’t run commands on your machine or access files or services for you.\n\nBeyond that, ask away — questions, advice, code help, brainstorming, explaining stuff in plain terms, whatever. What do you want to dive into right now?"
