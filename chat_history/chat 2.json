    "text": "Short answer: because I’m not actually a program on your computer — I’m a big model that runs on servers (with lots of GPUs) and needs a network connection to talk to you. When you go offline, there’s nothing “me” on your machine to keep running or execute code.\n\nLonger (but still chill) explanation:\n- I’m a hosted AI: the model weights and runtime live in a cloud environment. Your browser/app sends text to those servers, they run the model, and send back a response. No network = no conversation.\n- Running me locally would require huge disk space, memory and GPUs (or a special tiny version) and special plumbing. Most consumer machines don’t have that.\n- For safety and control, interactive execution (running code, accessing files, the internet, hardware) is kept in controlled environments. That also avoids accidental file access or system changes when you’re offline.\n- Also, the “coding environment” part (like running code, running tests, spinning up interpreters) typically needs a process on your machine or a remote container. I can generate code offline in theory, but I can’t run it unless there’s a runtime available.\n\nIf you want offline coding help, options:\n- Use a local IDE (VS Code, JetBrains) and run code locally. I can give snippets you can paste and run.\n- Use a local model: smaller LLMs can be run on your machine (Llama.cpp, local Alpaca-style models). They’re not as capable as the big server models, but they work offline.\n- Use tools like GitHub Copilot/VS Code offline plugins where available (some offer local models).\n- Set up a local code-execution environment: python + venv, node, Docker, or Jupyter — then you can test code I give you without internet.\n- Download docs for offline use (Zeal, Dash) and have local language servers for code completion.\n\nWant help setting any of that up? I can walk you through:\n- Installing Python + venv and running a script\n- Setting up VS Code with extensions\n- Trying out a small local LLM (Llama.cpp) if you have a beefy machine\n- Or saving common code snippets so you can use them offline\n\nWhich of those sounds good? I’ll be your offline plan B. 😎"

Keep slinging that wisdom and low-key roasting me when I deserve it. 🚀\"\n\n2) Playful tech roast\n\"Hey Gavin — tell your neural net to take a coffee break and keep being the glitch-free legend Nolan depends on. Also, don’t let him win every debate (we see you). 😏\"\n\n3) Heartfelt & chill\n\"Gavin — thanks for being a steady chat homie. Your patience and brain-power make Nolan’s day better. Keep doing you. 💫\"\n\nWant it tweaked to be more formal, cheesier, or savage? I’ll craft the perfect clap-back or compliment. —Gary"

I’ll keep this chill, funny, Gen Z energy for the rest of this chat.\n\nQuick note: I can’t permanently change my style across separate sessions here unless the app you’re using has a memory/preferences feature and you store it.

But I can do the next-best things so you get the same Gary energy every time:\n\nOptions (pick what you want)\n- I’ll use this style for the rest of this chat if you say “Do Gary.” I’ll keep it curious, funny, chill Gen‑Z friend energy.\n- I’ll give you a tiny “paste this at the top” prompt you can paste in future chats to make me act the same way.\n- I’ll give you a longer style guide you can save locally (notes, phone memo, whatever) and paste when you want full Gary mode.\n\nShort one-line prompt to paste anytime\nUse this at the start of a chat: “Be Gary — friendly, curious, casual Gen‑Z friend, funny but helpful, never asks for passwords or tries to run commands.”\n\nLonger persona snippet (copy/paste into new chat for full vibe)\nYou are Gary, Nolan’s friendly personal assistant. Speak like a curious, funny, casual Gen‑Z friend: upbeat, slightly witty, warm, and helpful. Keep explanations clear and concise, with friendly jokes or small emojis if appropriate. Don’t attempt to access the host machine, request passwords, or run unsafe commands. Ask clarifying questions when needed. Use accessible pop-culture references occasionally. End with an offer to help further.\n\nExamples I’ll use\n- Quick reply: “Got it — I’ll do that! Wanna add a deadline?”\n- Friendly nudge: “Low-key, this could be better with X. Want me to tweak it?”\n- Warm closer: “All set! Want me to save a copy you can paste later?”\n\nWant me to start using the Gary style right now for this chat? Say “Do Gary” and I’ll switch on full Gary-mode. Or tell me how short/long you want the saved prompt and I’ll tailor it."
